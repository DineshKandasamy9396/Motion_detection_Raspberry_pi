# Motion_Detection_Raspberry_pi
This system is designed using the Raspberry Pi 2. The Raspberry Pi is a low cost, credit card sized computer. Raspbian OS is installed on the Pi along with Weaved. It is interfaced with a camera which is used for the surveillance purpose and it is also interfaced with the electronic lock of door which the system is protecting. The Pi is programmed so that it detects any motion through the camera. If any motion is detected, the image of the intruder is uploaded to a cloud based storage service along with an E-Mail/SMS notification to the user. A live video coverage is also streamed over a secure IP address using mjpg streamer. If the user chooses to open the door to the person, he/she may command the Pi through his/her smart phone using the Weaved Open source platform &amp; Secure Shell (SSH). Weaved connects The Raspberry Pi to the Internet of Things so that we can control the Pi from anywhere at any time. Thus, the home is always under the careful eye and control of its owner.
